# General Skill Catalog A–Z — source review in progress

## Scope and source

Target: BWGR (2018), General Skill List, printed pp. 252–309,
PDF pp. 254–311. Starting commit: `ab10b9cd8fa9ceeced96b2a57b40fe1b179b2c0a`.
Branch: `skill-catalog-general-a-z`.

The user-provided PDF was read locally; extracted text and page images remain
outside the repository. This document contains project-authored summaries.
Issue #20, D-020–D-024 and foundation fixtures support, but do not replace, the PDF.
An independent manifest now contains 424 heading/topic candidates from the full
source index plus three named Doctrine variations from the entry body. Later
blocks still need entry-by-entry verification; 427 is a working manifest count,
not a final claim of source completeness. A–D has 126 reviewed complete skill
definitions and one separate choice expression. The full catalog is unfinished.

## Resolved source correction: Demonology / Empyrealia

Demonology (book p. 267 / PDF p. 269) names Ancient History, Obscure History,
Summoning and Doctrine as FoRK suggestions. Empyrealia (book p. 270 / PDF p. 272)
names Doctrine, Summoning and any ritual-type skill. The earlier ritual-category
attribution to Demonology was incorrect.

The user confirmed this correction and recorded it in
[Issue #20](https://github.com/langepok/Burning-Wheel-Character-Puncher/issues/20#issuecomment-6026263248).
The fixtures, hardening test and foundation documentation now reflect the
correction. Empyrealia supplies a real ritual-category representative; the two
identities remain separate. Suggestions remain guidance, not a whitelist.

## Resolved schema gap: conditional Script tools

Dwarven Rune Script (book p. 269 / PDF p. 271) and Elven Script (book p. 270 /
PDF p. 272) require generic expendable tools for writing only. Reading requires
no tools. The user approved a minimal conditional-tools extension.

ToolRequirement now supports a conditional node with a structured when context
and recursive then/otherwise branches. SkillContext distinguishes reading and
writing. Both fixtures encode writing -> generic expendable tools, otherwise
-> none. Existing tool leaves and allOf/anyOf compositions remain supported.

`tests/data/general-skill-source-gaps.test.ts` checks positive assignability,
fixture metadata, serialization, nesting and malformed context/branch rejection.
These are metadata/integrity tests, not a tool evaluator.

## Resolved schema gap: contextual Resources recovery

Visually verified Blacksmith, book p. 260 / PDF p. 262: it can replenish taxed
Resources if a suitable place to practice the trade is available.

The user confirmed the condition and approved an optional ResourceInteraction
context plus a general circumstance-id leaf. Blacksmith's partial source fixture
now carries suitable-workplace on recovery, independently of Workshop tools.
No specific workshop inventory, employment contract or recovery calculation is
inferred. Resource contexts are recursively validated, including family defaults.

Positive tests replace the previous negative schema reproducer: Blacksmith's
context survives serialization, changing tools does not change recovery, plain
recovery remains valid, and malformed circumstance/context nodes are rejected.

### Resources qualifier scan before the extension

Searched the complete extracted source range for Resources, taxed, recovery,
replenishment and cash, then checked the relevant recovery entries. The eight
explicit recovery entries are Accounting and Administration (book p. 253),
Beggardry (259), Blacksmith (260), Carpentry (263), Estate Management and
Extortion (271), and Waiting Tables (307). Only Blacksmith explicitly adds the
suitable-place qualifier to recovery. Carpentry also has Workshop tools without
that qualifier; the two facts must not be conflated. Beggardry additionally
produces cash.

Other Resources mentions describe different interactions: Amercement sets fines,
Appraisal supports valuation, Games of Chance describes stakes and tax/cash
outcomes, and Gem Artifice/Jewelcraft/White-Metal Artifice affect item value.
These are not silently converted into ordinary recovery. No additional recovery
qualifier was found that requires a different shape for the approved context.
The scan is not a claim to have transcribed those later skill definitions.

## Resolved stage reference: Antiphon Union Training

Visually verified book p. 255 / PDF p. 257. Its Tools line states that the
Training itself takes no tools but refers to the skill song. The surrounding
description requires an item created with a skill song, with Jewelcraft, Riddle
of Steel and Weaving Way given as examples, before the spell-song stage.

The user chose a structured magic-integration reference, not a ToolRequirement
extension. Antiphon's own tools are none. The magic integration records the
preceding base-item-creation stage, requires an applicable skill song, and says
creation follows that selected skill's own rules/tools. The printed song examples
are not an exhaustive list. The reference is not generic tool inheritance and
does not assert that creation tools are required during later enchantment.

The integration union permits this metadata on magic integrations only. Tests
check the stage/reference, serialization, malformed metadata rejection and
unchanged Antiphon tools when another song's tools change. No evaluator, copied
tools, automatic propagation or runtime prose parsing is added. This case no
longer blocks A–D transcription.

## Reviewed A–D block

The separate General transcription module contains 126 complete records:
83 ordinary skill identities, 40 named Wise topics (including the explicitly
overridden Black Legion-wise), and three named Doctrine variations. Appropriate
Weapons remains a choice. All 127 reviewed manifest rows match id, name, kind and
source pages; registration resolves the block's references and serialization
preserves nested metadata. Later blocks remain identity references, not fake
complete definitions or imported partial fixtures.

The Doctrine variations are Cult Doctrine, Foreign Doctrine and Heretical
Doctrine, explicitly named within Doctrine (book p. 268). They share the printed
Doctrine metadata and remain separately identified, without creating a Doctrine
family or requiring knowledge of the base skill first. Their stated acquisition
routes are an available lifepath grant or General skill points; this is not a new
spending evaluator.

The generic Wises entry actually prints Special (book p. 309 / PDF p. 311).
The earlier foundation default Wise was unsupported and is corrected in both
fixture and transcription family metadata. Named Black Legion-wise still prints
Wise and requires tools; no blanket normalization applies to named overrides.

### A–D source anomalies retained explicitly

- Ages of the Etharch is singular in the heading; preserve that printed name.
- Boss-wise is on book p. 261, despite the Skill Index's p. 260 reference.
- Caulking-wise appears on book p. 263 but is absent from the Skill Index.
- Reading, Engineer, Carpenter and Illumination source FoRK labels do not match
  the corresponding General headings exactly. They remain unresolved source
  references with probable targets as audit metadata, not resolved aliases.
- Rhyme of Rules refers outside the General list to a spell song; it is preserved
  as a source reference, not fabricated as a complete General skill.
- Chronology of Kings describes Dwarven history but does not print a stock
  restriction. Its availability is not inferred from that description.
- Brawling's Power substitution is scoped to Lock/Push; a curated circumstance
  id preserves the stated action scope without a Fight evaluator.
- Code of Citadels is not given a song category merely because it is Elven and
  magical. Explicit song descriptions support the categories on Call of the Wild,
  Ballad of History and Dignity of the Wilderlands.

## Pending E–H schema case: created-item Resources value

Visually verified Gem Artifice and Gemcraft, book p. 275 / PDF p. 277.
Gem Artifice raises a created gem/stone's Resources obstacle by one; an optional
increase of two to the crafting-test obstacle raises that Resources obstacle by
one more. Gemcraft instead adds one die of Resources value to the created stone.
These units and effects are distinct. They do not recover taxed Resources or
produce the Beggardry cash grant.

ResourceInteraction currently admits only recovery and cash; general integrations
have no structured item-value adjustment metadata. Tags or a prose summary alone
would not preserve the unit/amount/tradeoff as structured mechanics. No engine
is needed to store those facts, but the representational boundary needs a decision.

Minimal proposed direction, **not implemented**: a created-item-value adjustment
descriptor with explicit unit (Resources obstacle versus Resources value dice),
amount and the optional Gem Artifice crafting-obstacle tradeoff. Alternatively,
place that descriptor on equipment/Resources integration metadata rather than
the repeated ResourceInteraction union. Neither option evaluates crafting or
Resources. Do not normalize either unit or invent repeatability for the tradeoff.

The source-gap test proves the current interaction type cannot store the proposed
source-shaped descriptors. E–H production transcription is paused pending user
resolution, rather than representing these as recovery/cash or claiming A–Z done.

## Planned oracle and integrity coverage

1. An independent manifest checks exact ids, source names, entry kinds and pages;
   missing, extra or duplicate production entries fail the comparison.
2. Complete production records satisfy required metadata and provenance;
   partial fixtures cannot substitute for them.
3. Check nested references, conditions, roots, integration ownership, families
   and special FoRK links. Preserve unresolved Alchemical explicitly.
4. Keep training, source spelling, identity, conditional roots, Astrology/Rune
   Casting, literacy, tools and family regressions.
5. Classify lifepath references as General, stock-specific/out-of-scope, choice
   or unresolved. This join remains unaudited.
6. Run block-level checks and final npm ci/typecheck/test/build plus diff-check.
   Passing foundation tests do not establish A–Z completeness.

## Current verification

A–D and resolved source/schema corrections pass a clean dependency install,
typecheck, all 335 tests across 12 files, build and diff whitespace checks.
Final A–Z counts and the lifepath-reference join remain pending; no full A–Z PR
is open. The pending created-item-value descriptor is a schema reproducer only.
